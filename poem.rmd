## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
 
  How doth the little crocodile 
  
  Improve his shining tail, 
  
  And pour the waters of the Nile
  
  On every golden scale! 
  
  How cheerfully he seems to grin...
  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  
  And sorry I could not travel both
  
  And be one traveler, long I stood
  
  And looked down one as far as I could
  
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

  "The sun was shining on the sea,
  
  Shining with all his might
  
  He did his very best to make
  
  The billows smooth and bright â€”
  
  And this was odd, because it was
  
  The middle of the night.
  
  
  The moon was shining sulkily,
  
  Because she thought the sun
  
  Had got no business to be there
  
  After the day was done -
  
  "It's very rude of him," she said,
  
  "To come and spoil the fun."

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

  In the twilight where shadows creep,
  
  Whispers of secrets in the dark, they seep.
  
  Pumpkins grinning with candlelit smiles,
  
  Goblins and ghouls roam through the miles.
  
  
  Crisp leaves crunch underfoot, a ghostly dance,
  
  Mischievous spirits in a fleeting glance.
  
  The moon hangs low, a silver eye,
  
  As bats take flight, painting the sky.
  
  
  Costumes of witches, fairies, and mimes,
  
  Children with laughter, in playful rhymes.
  
  Trick or treat echoes through the night,
  
  A quest for candy, a sweet delight.
  
  
  Fog rolls in like a shroud of dreams,
  
  Casting a spell with its silvery seams.
  
  Old tales whisper of haunted grounds,
  
  Where echoes of laughter and fear abound.
  
  
  Candles flicker in windows aglow,
  
  Guiding the lost where they dare not go.
  
  With every creak of the old, worn floor,
  
  The past comes alive with a haunting roar.
  
  
  So gather your courage, embrace the fright,
  
  For Halloween's magic ignites the night.
  
  A dance of the eerie, a song of the brave,
  
  In the heart of the dark, we all find our cave.
